## Introduction

Welcome to Gootalk, my social network app.
This project was built as a side project, with the goal to sharpen my M.E.R.N. stack coding skills in mind.

I'm updating this app from time to time, adding features and fixing bugs.

This app was built with the following tools and technologies:

**Client**:

- React
- Redux
- CSS

**Server**:

- Node.js
- Express.js

**Database**:

- MongoDB
- Mongoose

I've added a **demo** login, for an easy - register-free access.

In addition, this project was deployed to **Heroku**.

## Key Features

- Register with your own user to get connected with friends.
- Share your thoughts with your friends.
- Like and comment on posts.
- Share images and videos with your friends.
- Enjoy a beautiful and responsive UI.

## Get Started

Register with a new profile, or login to an existing profile (all of your data will be editable later on profile page/settings page).

Look for your friends on the search bar and ask for friendship.
When they will accept your friendship request, you'll be able to comment on their posts.

Now you can share your thoughts, images and videos will the people you want!

## Tips and tricks

- **To edit your profile**, just go to your profile page (from the navigation bar menu, or from the left main menu) and click on the edit button in the top right corner.
